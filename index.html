      <div id="aboutUs">The Build a Building Block City Builders Club (BBBCBC) is a club that constructs buildings out of
        building blocks. Beyond, there is much more. A coalition of the creative spirit. A melding of the engineering
      mind. Exploration of the unknown and the once-thought-known.
      Those who share in the BBBCBC experience learn about urban planning, architecture, sustainability, and much more.
      They learn about their own potential for creative thought and the limitless opportunities found in a handful of
      blocks.
      The following represents a year's collection of weekly building models, competition winners, and some spurious
      designs. Over 70 learners have joined the club and contributed to the growth of the BBBCBC's Neverending City.
      Thank you to all who have helped this city grow and to all those who shall do so in the future.</div>
